# gptSurveySummarizer

A discord bot for natural language surveys, inspired by and in the style of [talk to the city](https://github.com/AIObjectives/talk-to-the-city-reports).

Join the discord server for discussing and developing this tool [here](https://discord.gg/2cmxYYMyHN).

## Usage

1. Create a .env.local file with the following variables:

   ```shell
   DISCORD_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXX
   OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXX
   REDIS_HOST=XXXXXX without port
   REDIS_PORT=XXXXX
   REDIS_PASSWORD=XXXXXXX
   CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXX
   GUILD_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
   SUMMARIZE_FREQUENCY_SECONDS=3600
   ```

1. Run `npm install`
1. Fill the REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT and REDIS_PASSWORD for connecting your Redis DB
   - Go to [Redis](https://redis.io/) and create an account.
   - Create a db and click ```connect``` copy and paste your password, socket and port into .env.local file
   - You can see the redis configuration in ```config.js```
1. Start the main bot script with `npm run bot`
1. Or Start the main bot script with `npm run dev` to use nodemon in development phase.
1. Start the gpt summarization script with `npm run summarizer`

## Docker image

### Build it

```
docker build -t <your-image-name>:<your-image-tag> .
```

### Run it

The image has two operational modes: **bot** by default and **summarizer**

To run the bot use the `bot` argument and to run the summarizer use `summarizer`.

```
docker run -it -d --env-file ./.env <your-image-name>:<your-image-tag> bot
```

The `--env-file` flag takes a filename as an argument and expects each line to be in the VAR=VAL format, mimicking the argument passed to `--env`. Comment lines need only be prefixed with #

### Test it

```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Contributions

To make a contribution do the following steps:

1. Make an issue that includes a user story for what the user should be able to do (eg user should be able to view the survey summary in their local language).
2. Get that issue approved by the product owners (for now just me / Evan / es92).
3. Write a PR and get that approved by the code owners (for now also just me / Evan / es92). Each PR must correspond to an approved issue. By default PRs should be merged by the PR submitter, though in some cases if changes are needed they can be merged by code owners.
